Potential improvement


1. Sentence tokenization
	Do not split on ":","---" etc. Sometimes the answer is embedded in a long sentence. For instance, "There are four types of kangaroo: ... "

2. Reference resolution
	E.g. they, your, her etc.

3. Yes/No questions needs improvement. Right now, everything is based on the fuzzy matching between questions and candidate sentences. Need to parse the sentences to get scemantic meaning. 

4. Wh- question: redefine sentence similarity by taking account of question type first. For instance, for Why-type of quesiton, look at sentence that contains because, since, for, because of etc. Similarity measure for why has been implemented already, but it needs improvement. 

5. Need to consider the situation where the actual answer is in the clause. 

6. Need to improve the "Who" question. The answer may not be a PERSON (returned by stanford tagger)

7. Need to improve the "When" question. The answer may not be a Location (returned by stanford tagger)

8. Need to deal with 'which' and 'how'

9. Need to improve 'what' question that do not have a NP VP answer. For instance: 
	- what is used to do ... 

10. Deal with try except
