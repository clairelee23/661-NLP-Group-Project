A	kangaroo	be	a	marsupial	from	the	family	Macropodidae	(	macropods	,	mean	'large	foot	'	)	.
In	common	use	the	term	be	use	to	describe	the	largest	specie	from	this	family	,	the	Red	Kangaroo	,	the	Antilopine	Kangaroo	,	and	the	Eastern	and	Western	Grey	Kangaroo	of	the	Macropus	genus	.
The	family	also	include	many	smaller	specie	which	include	the	wallaby	,	tree-kangaroos	,	wallaroos	,	pademelon	and	the	Quokka	,	some	63	living	specie	in	all	.
Kangaroos	be	endemic	to	the	continent	of	Australia	,	while	the	smaller	macropods	be	find	in	Australia	and	New	Guinea	.
In	general	,	larger	kangaroo	have	adapt	much	better	to	change	work	to	the	Australian	landscape	by	human	and	though	many	of	their	smaller	cousin	be	endanger	,	they	be	plentiful	.
They	be	not	farm	to	any	extent	,	but	wild	kangaroo	be	shoot	for	meat	,	over	which	there	be	controversy	.

The	collective	noun	for	kangaroo	be	a	mob	,	troop	,	or	court	.
Kangaroos	be	sometimes	colloquially	refer	to	a	roos	.
A	Tasmanian	Forester	(	Eastern	Grey	)	Kangaroo	in	motion	.
There	be	four	specie	that	be	commonly	refer	to	a	kangaroo	:
*	The	Red	Kangaroo	(	Macropus	rufus	)	be	the	largest	survive	marsupial	anywhere	in	the	world	.
Fewer	in	number	,	the	Red	Kangaroo	occupy	the	arid	and	semi-arid	centre	of	the	continent	.
A	large	male	can	be	2	metre	(	6	ft	7	in	)	tall	and	weigh	90	kg	(	200	lb	)	.
*	The	Eastern	Grey	Kangaroo	(	Macropus	giganteus	)	be	le	well-known	than	the	red	(	outside	of	Australia	)	,	but	the	most	often	see	,	a	it	range	cover	the	fertile	eastern	part	of	the	continent	.
*	The	Western	Grey	Kangaroo	(	Macropus	fuliginosus	)	be	slightly	smaller	again	at	about	54	kg	(	119	lb	)	for	a	large	male	.
It	be	find	in	the	southern	part	of	Western	Australia	,	South	Australia	near	the	coast	,	and	the	Darling	River	basin	.
*	The	Antilopine	Kangaroo	(	Macropus	antilopinus	)	be	,	essentially	,	the	far-northern	equivalent	of	the	Eastern	and	Western	Grey	Kangaroos	.
Like	them	,	it	be	a	creature	of	the	grassy	plain	and	woodland	,	and	gregarious	.
In	addition	,	there	be	about	50	smaller	macropods	closely	relate	to	the	kangaroo	in	the	family	Macropodidae	.
Red	Kangaroo	(	Macropus	rufus	)
Europeans	have	long	regard	Kangaroos	a	strange	animal	.
Early	explorer	describe	them	a	creature	that	have	head	like	deer	(	without	antler	)	,	stand	upright	like	men	,	and	hop	like	frog	.
Combined	with	the	two-headed	appearance	of	a	mother	kangaroo	,	this	lead	many	back	home	to	dismiss	them	a	traveller	'	tale	for	quite	some	time	.
Kangaroos	have	large	,	powerful	hind	leg	,	large	foot	adapt	for	leaping	,	a	long	muscular	tail	for	balance	,	and	a	small	head	.
Like	all	marsupial	,	female	kangaroo	have	a	pouch	call	a	marsupium	in	which	joeys	complete	postnatal	development	.
Kangaroos	be	the	only	large	animal	to	use	hopping	a	a	mean	of	locomotion	.
The	comfortable	hopping	speed	for	Red	Kangaroo	be	about	20	25	km/h	(	13	16	mph	)	,	but	speed	of	up	to	70	km/h	(	44	mph	)	can	be	attain	,	over	short	distance	,	while	it	can	sustain	a	speed	of	40	km/h	(	25	mph	)	for	nearly	two	kilometre	.
This	fast	and	energy-efficient	method	of	travel	have	evolve	because	of	the	need	to	regularly	cover	large	distance	in	search	of	food	and	water	,	rather	than	the	need	to	escape	predator	.
Because	of	it	long	foot	,	it	can	not	walk	correctly	.
To	move	at	slow	speed	,	it	use	it	tail	to	form	a	tripod	with	it	two	forelimb	.
It	then	raise	it	hind	foot	forward	,	in	a	form	of	locomotion	call	``	crawl-walking	.	''
The	average	life	expectancy	of	a	kangaroo	be	about	4	6	year	.
Different	specie	of	kangaroo	eat	different	diet	.
Eastern	grey	kangaroo	be	predominantly	grazers	eat	a	wide	variety	of	grass	whereas	some	other	specie	(	e.g	.
red	kangaroo	and	swamp	wallaby	)	include	significant	amount	of	shrub	in	the	diet	.
The	smaller	specie	of	kangaroo	also	consume	hypogeal	fungi	.
Many	specie	be	nocturnal	Archives	URL	access	January	7	,	2007.	and	crepuscular	,	Columbus	Zoo	article	URL	access	January	7	,	2007.	usually	spend	the	day	rest	in	shade	and	the	cool	evening	,	night	and	morning	move	about	and	feeding	.
Because	of	it	grazing	,	kangaroo	have	develop	specialize	teeth	.
Its	incisor	be	able	to	crop	grass	close	to	the	ground	,	and	it	molar	chop	and	grind	the	grass	.
Since	the	two	side	of	the	lower	jaw	be	not	join	together	,	the	lower	incisor	be	farther	apart	,	give	the	kangaroo	a	wider	bite	.
The	silica	in	grass	be	abrasive	,	so	kangaroo	molar	move	forward	a	they	be	grind	down	,	and	eventually	fall	out	,	replace	by	new	teeth	that	grow	in	the	back	.
Despite	have	a	herbivorous	diet	similar	to	ruminant	such	a	cattle	which	release	large	quantity	of	methane	through	exhaling	and	eructation	,	kangaroos	release	virtually	none	.
The	hydrogen	byproduct	of	fermentation	be	instead	convert	into	acetate	,	which	be	then	use	to	provide	further	energy	.
Scientists	be	interested	in	the	possibility	of	transfer	the	bacteria	responsible	from	kangaroo	to	cattle	,	since	the	greenhouse	gas	effect	of	methane	be	23	time	greater	than	that	of	carbon	dioxide	.

Kangaroos	have	few	natural	predator	.
The	Thylacine	,	consider	by	palaeontologist	to	have	once	be	a	major	natural	predator	of	the	kangaroo	,	be	now	extinct	.
Other	extinct	predator	include	the	Marsupial	Lion	,	Megalania	and	the	Wonambi	.
However	,	with	the	arrival	of	human	in	Australia	at	least	50,000	year	ago	and	the	introduction	of	the	dingo	about	5,000	year	ago	,	kangaroo	have	have	to	adapt	.
The	mere	barking	of	a	dog	can	set	a	full-grown	male	boomer	into	a	wild	frenzy	.
Wedge-tailed	Eagles	and	other	raptor	usually	eat	kangaroo	carrion	.

Newborn	joey	suck	on	a	teat	in	the	pouch
Kangaroos	have	develop	a	number	of	adaptation	to	a	dry	,	infertile	continent	and	highly	variable	climate	.
As	with	all	marsupial	,	the	young	be	bear	at	a	very	early	stage	of	development	after	a	gestation	of	31	36	day	.
At	this	stage	,	only	the	forelimb	be	somewhat	developed	,	to	allow	the	newborn	to	climb	to	the	pouch	and	attach	to	a	teat	.
In	comparison	,	a	human	embryo	at	a	similar	stage	of	development	would	be	about	seven	week	old	,	and	premature	baby	bear	at	le	than	23	week	be	usually	not	mature	enough	to	survive	.
The	joey	will	usually	stay	in	the	pouch	for	about	nine	month	(	180	320	day	for	the	Western	Grey	)	before	start	to	leave	the	pouch	for	small	period	of	time	.
It	be	usually	feed	by	it	mother	until	reach	18	month	.
The	female	kangaroo	be	usually	pregnant	in	permanence	,	except	on	the	day	she	give	birth	;	however	,	she	have	the	ability	to	freeze	the	development	of	an	embryo	until	the	previous	joey	be	able	to	leave	the	pouch	.
This	be	know	a	diapause	,	and	will	occur	in	time	of	drought	and	in	area	with	poor	food	source	.
The	composition	of	the	milk	produce	by	the	mother	vary	accord	to	the	need	of	the	joey	.
In	addition	,	the	mother	be	able	to	produce	two	different	kind	of	milk	simultaneously	for	the	newborn	and	the	older	joey	still	in	the	pouch	.
Unusually	,	during	a	dry	period	,	male	will	not	produce	sperm	,	and	female	will	only	conceive	if	there	have	be	enough	rain	to	produce	a	large	quantity	of	green	vegetation	.
Hindleg	of	a	kangaroo	Kangaroos	and	wallaby	have	large	,	stretchy	tendon	in	their	hind	leg	.
They	store	elastic	strain	energy	in	the	tendon	of	their	large	hind	leg	,	provide	most	of	the	energy	require	for	each	hop	by	the	spring	action	of	the	tendon	rather	than	by	any	muscular	effort	.
This	be	true	in	all	animal	specie	which	have	muscle	connect	to	their	skeleton	through	elastic	element	such	a	tendon	,	but	the	effect	be	more	pronounced	in	kangaroo	.
There	be	also	a	link	between	the	hop	action	and	breathing	:	a	the	foot	leave	the	ground	,	air	be	expel	from	the	lung	;	bring	the	foot	forward	ready	for	land	refill	the	lung	,	provide	further	energy	efficiency	.
Studies	of	kangaroo	and	wallaby	have	demonstrate	that	,	beyond	the	minimum	energy	expenditure	require	to	hop	at	all	,	increase	speed	require	very	little	extra	effort	(	much	le	than	the	same	speed	increase	in	,	say	,	a	horse	,	dog	or	human	)	,	and	that	the	extra	energy	be	require	to	carry	extra	weight	.
For	kangaroo	,	the	key	benefit	of	hopping	be	not	speed	to	escape	predator	the	top	speed	of	a	kangaroo	be	no	higher	than	that	of	a	similarly-sized	quadruped	,	and	the	Australian	native	predator	be	in	any	case	le	fearsome	than	those	of	other	continent	but	economy	:	in	an	infertile	continent	with	highly	variable	weather	pattern	,	the	ability	of	a	kangaroo	to	travel	long	distance	at	moderately	high	speed	in	search	of	food	source	be	crucial	to	survival	.
A	sequencing	project	of	the	Kangaroo	genome	be	start	in	2004	a	a	collaboration	between	Australia	(	mainly	fund	by	the	state	of	Victoria	)	and	the	National	Institutes	of	Health	in	the	US	.

The	genome	of	a	marsupial	such	a	the	kangaroo	be	of	great	interest	to	scientist	study	comparative	genomics	because	marsupial	be	at	an	ideal	degree	of	evolutionary	divergence	from	human	:	mouse	be	too	close	and	have	n't	develop	many	different	function	,	while	bird	be	genetically	too	remote	.
The	dairy	industry	have	also	express	some	interest	in	this	project	.
Eye	disease	be	rare	but	not	new	among	kangaroo	.
The	first	official	report	of	kangaroo	blindness	take	place	in	1994	,	in	central	New	South	Wales	.
The	following	year	,	report	of	blind	kangaroo	appear	in	Victoria	and	South	Australia	.
By	1996	,	the	disease	have	spread	``	across	the	desert	to	Western	Australia	''	.
Australian	authority	be	concern	that	the	disease	could	spread	to	other	livestock	and	possibly	human	.
Researchers	at	the	Australian	Animal	Health	Laboratories	in	Geelong	detect	a	virus	call	the	Wallal	virus	in	two	specie	of	midge	,	believe	to	have	be	the	carrier	.
Veterinarians	also	discover	that	le	than	three	percent	of	kangaroo	expose	to	the	virus	develop	blindness	.
Before	European	settlement	,	the	kangaroo	be	a	very	important	animal	for	Australian	Aborigines	,	for	it	meat	,	hide	,	bone	and	sinew	.
In	addition	,	there	be	important	Dreaming	story	and	ceremony	involve	the	kangaroo	.

European	settler	cut	down	forest	to	create	vast	grassland	for	sheep	and	cattle	graze	,	add	stock	water	point	in	arid	area	,	and	have	substantially	reduce	the	number	of	dingo	.
Kangaroos	be	shy	and	retire	by	nature	,	and	in	normal	circumstance	present	no	threat	to	human	.
Male	kangaroo	often	``	box	''	amongst	each	other	,	playfully	,	for	dominance	,	or	in	competition	for	mate	.
The	dexterity	of	their	forepaw	be	utilise	in	both	punching	and	grappling	with	the	foe	,	but	the	real	danger	lie	in	a	serious	kick	with	the	hindleg	.
The	sharpen	toenail	can	disembowel	an	opponent	.
There	be	very	few	record	of	kangaroo	attack	human	without	provocation	,	however	several	such	unprovoked	attack	in	2004	spurred	fear	of	a	rabies-like	disease	possibly	affect	the	marsupial	.

Kangaroos	dazzle	by	headlight	or	startle	by	engine	noise	have	be	know	to	leap	in	front	of	car	.
Since	kangaroos	in	mid-bound	can	reach	speed	of	around	50	km/h	(	31	mph	)	and	be	relatively	heavy	,	the	force	of	impact	can	be	severe	.
Small	vehicle	may	be	destroy	,	while	larger	vehicle	may	suffer	engine	damage	.
The	risk	of	harm	to	vehicle	occupant	be	greatly	increase	if	the	windscreen	be	the	point	of	impact	.
As	a	result	,	``	kangaroo	cross	''	sign	be	commonplace	in	Australia	.
Vehicles	that	frequent	isolated	road	,	where	roadside	assistance	may	be	scarce	,	be	often	fit	with	``	roo	bar	''	to	minimise	damage	cause	by	collision	.
Bonnet-mounted	device	,	design	to	scare	wildlife	off	the	road	with	ultrasound	and	other	method	,	have	be	devise	and	market	.
If	a	female	be	the	victim	of	a	collision	,	animal	welfare	group	ask	that	her	pouch	be	check	for	any	survive	joey	,	in	which	case	it	may	be	remove	to	a	wildlife	sanctuary	or	veterinary	surgeon	for	rehabilitation	.
Likewise	,	when	an	adult	kangaroo	be	injure	in	a	collision	,	a	vet	,	the	RSPCA	or	the	National	Parks	and	Wildlife	Service	can	be	consult	for	instruction	on	proper	care	.
In	New	South	Wales	,	rehabilitation	of	kangaroo	be	carry	out	by	volunteer	from	WIRES	.
Occasionally	,	individual	take	on	the	task	of	rear	a	recovered	joey	themselves	.
The	rule-of-thumb	say	that	if	the	joey	be	already	cover	with	fur	at	the	time	of	the	accident	(	a	oppose	to	still	be	in	it	embryonic	stage	)	,	it	stand	a	good	chance	of	grow	up	properly	.

They	hop	readily	into	a	cloth	bag	when	it	be	lower	in	front	of	them	approximately	to	the	height	where	the	mother	's	pouch	would	be	.
The	joey	's	instinct	be	to	``	cuddle	up	''	,	thereby	endear	themselves	to	their	keeper	,	but	after	hand-rearing	a	joey	,	it	can	not	usually	be	release	into	the	wild	and	be	expect	to	provide	for	itself	immediately	.
Usually	wildlife	sanctuary	be	willing	to	adopt	kangaroo	which	be	no	longer	practical	,	or	have	grow	too	large	to	contain	,	need	at	least	1	acre	and	7ft	boundary	fence	for	a	fully	grown	kangaroo	.
Kangaroos	have	be	feature	on	coin	,	a	well	a	be	use	a	emblem	and	logo	.
